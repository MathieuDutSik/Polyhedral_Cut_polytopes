INFO about this section

It is written for the special purpose of
working with general supermetric cones.
The implementation is done using a list of sets.

At present it
--Build general orbits (non-negative and super simplex)
--Build the groups
--Build the representation groups
--Build the Partition extreme rays of m-HMETn
--Build the associated graphs

It should
--Build extreme rays of (m,m)-SMETn
