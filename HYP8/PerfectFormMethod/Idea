If D is a perfect Delaunay polytopes, then we associate
to its vector set v1, ...., vM the vector family
v'1=(1,v1), ...., v'M=(1, vM)

We then have that there D is extreme if and only if there exist
a unique matrix A such that 
Tr(A p(v'i) )=0

p(v'i)=t(v'i) v'i

But actually the vectors v'i do not define a perfect form:
--reason 1: their dimension is one too much
--reason 2: there exist some vectors of shorter norm a priori.
